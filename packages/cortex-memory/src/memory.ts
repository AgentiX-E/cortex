/**
 * `CortexMemory` — `cortex-core`'s value gates composed into one conformant
 * `MemorySystem`.
 *
 * This is the file that closes `AUDIT-CODE-VS-DOCS.md` §6. Before it existed,
 * `decideWrite` and `decideRetrieval` had no production caller, so the
 * cognitive layer was unreachable and every claim about it was untestable.
 *
 * The flow per question is:
 *
 *   turns -> admitSessions (decideWrite, per session) -> selectSessionBudget
 *         -> buildPrompt (per answer contract) -> LLM.complete -> parseAnswer
 *
 * Two properties are deliberate:
 *
 * 1. **No evidence means no LLM call.** When the gates admit nothing the answer
 *    is `null`. The reference pipeline reaches abstention by asking the model to
 *    notice an absence; here the absence is detected before the model is
 *    consulted, which cannot hallucinate and does not cost a request.
 * 2. **The contract is structural.** Plain object literals satisfy it, no class
 *    hierarchy is required, and `answerPreference` is deliberately absent.

  /**
   * Abstention answering.

   * This is the path where the cognitive layer has a mechanism rather than just
   * a wording change. `decideRetrieval` returns
   * `{retrieve:false, reason:'below-threshold'}` when the best candidate is
   * below the threshold, and that is a machine-derived abstention: the system
   * declines before the model is consulted. When the gate does admit evidence
   * the conservative contract is still used, because the question may have no
   * answer even though related evidence exists.
   *
   * ## The docstring above described code that did not exist
   *
   * It is kept because it is still the intent, and rewritten below because for
   * a measured period **it was not true**. `decideRetrieval` had no call site in
   * this package -- grepping for it returned docstrings and one barrel comment --
   * so this method abstained only on an empty admission, and every other
   * abstention in a run was the model's response to the `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`
   * instruction. The layer had a *wording* change and no mechanism.
   *
   * Dispatch `37094200823` is what made it visible, and only because the arm
   * measured against a system that does have a mechanism: 6.40% against the
   * reference pipeline's 85.20%, with abstention at 95.40% and the per-capability
   * table showing ABS at 100% while IE, MR, KU and TR sat between 0.00% and
   * 0.83%. A system that declines everything is indistinguishable from a system
   * whose "abstention mechanism" is an instruction string.
   *
   * The tests in `abstention-decision.test.ts` assert the property that was
   * missing -- the model is **not consulted** when the gate decides to abstain
   * (`seen).toHaveLength(0)`) -- rather than that the name `decideRetrieval`
   * appears in this file. That distinction is load-bearing here: the name
   * appeared in the comments all along, so a textual assertion would have passed
   * on the broken code.
