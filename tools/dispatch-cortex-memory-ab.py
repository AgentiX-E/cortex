"""Dispatch the `cortex-memory` A/B (roadmap step 3).

Why a script: the sandbox admits api.github.com only, `gh` is unusable, and the
dispatch has to name the exact commit. Passing `ref` is what makes the run a
controlled comparison: without it the workflow picks up whatever master is at
dispatch time, and the two sides can land on different code -- which is how the
run recorded in §13 produced two byte-identical arms and a verdict about the
dispatch.

Why one invocation and not two: this arm's two sides run in the SAME job, through
one `runAblationReport` call, because they are different systems rather than two
configurations of one. That is the pairing invariant the pre-registration
document fixes (`docs/PREREGISTRATION-CORTEX-MEMORY-ARM.md` §2.2), and splitting
the dispatch would break it into a staggered comparison -- time-of-day drift is
1.7-2.1pp, larger than most effects this arm could find.

Pre-registered before dispatch, per AUDIT-CODE-VS-DOCS.md §6.3:

  - the point estimate it must beat: the BASELINE side of this same dispatch;
  - success: McNemar p < 0.05 with delta > 0, two-sided, overall
    abstention-aware accuracy, full N=500, 4 runs, temperature 0;
  - stopping rule: one dispatch, no peeking, no re-running for a better draw.

The `CORTEX_MEMORY` toggle is what enables the arm; `cortex-eval`'s CLI skips it
when unset, and `cortex-memory/bench/run-ablation.ts` is the entry point that
constructs both sides. The workflow step that invokes it is added alongside this
script.

# The configuration registered in `docs/PREREGISTRATION-CORTEX-MEMORY-ARM.md` §10.3,
# held constant. These values are not free parameters of this script: §10 fixed them
# before the run, and `tools/__tests__/test_preregistration_config.py` asserts that what
# is sent here is what that section names. Changing a number here without amending §10
# is the fourth form of the §7.3 defect -- the artifact would describe the intent.
#
# `limit: '0'` is the full 500 questions -- this arm's point estimate must be measured
# on the whole set, because a 60-question sample gives a Wilson interval too wide to
# distinguish the null the arm expects from the effect it is looking for.
#
# `cortex_memory_retrieval_threshold` is sent explicitly as the string `'0.25'`, not
# left to the workflow default. The empty string GitHub substitutes for an unfilled
# input parses to `0` today, so omitting it would produce a different run than the one
# registered -- and it would arrive through the `''` -> `Number('')` path that §38
# identified as the source of two separate defects. A configuration this run depends
# on should not arrive via an accident.
#
# The value is `0.25`, NOT the `0` this key carried through §7.5. §9 raised the
# reachable ceiling by giving `sourceTrust` a caller, and §10 is the REGISTRATION that
# spends that change: §10.3 names `retrievalThreshold: 0.25` as "the midpoint of the
# interval the ceiling makes reachable". A dispatch that kept sending `0` would run
# the §7.5 configuration while the registration named a different one -- §7.3's
# side-channel defect in its fourth form, where the KEY is declared and forwarded
# correctly and only the VALUE disagrees. §10.6's check names `sourceTrust` alone, so
# it cannot catch this; the guard for it is `test_preregistration_config.py`, which
# compares these values against §10.3 itself.
#
# `cortex_memory_source_trust` is sent for the third reason: the variable did not
# exist in `INPUTS` at all until now, and neither did the workflow input behind it.
# A dispatch that names a threshold the arm cannot compare against is the §7.3
# side-channel defect in its third form -- the run completes, and its artifact
# describes the configuration the operator intended rather than the one the code
# applied. `0.5` is the value `admission.ts` hardcoded before the field existed, so
# stating it explicitly keeps this dispatch comparable to runs `37110579101` and
# `37094200823` while making the ceiling a fact on the record instead of a property
# of a literal someone has to go read.
#
# `cortex_memory_threshold` is sent as `'0'` for the reason above applied to the other
# gate. §10.3 registers `threshold: 0`; this key was previously OMITTED, on the argument
# that the workflow default also lands on `0`. That argument is the one the paragraph
# above rejects: it lands there through `''` -> `readNumeric` -> default, and a
# registered value should not arrive via an accident. The omission is also invisible --
# an absent key cannot disagree with anything, so no artifact could show that the
# registered `threshold` was never stated. `test_preregistration_config.py` found it by
# comparing the dispatch against §10.3 rather than against the workflow's defaults.
